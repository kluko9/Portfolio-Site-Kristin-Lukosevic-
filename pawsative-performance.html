            <div id="findings"><!-- what ive learned-->
              <h2> Summary</h2>
              <p>While working on the design for Pawsative Performance I have acquired many new skills. I now understand guidelines for both IOS and Android devices ensuring that Pawsative Performance will be easy to navigate on each device. The main focus for Pawsative Performance was determined through user research, all users have busy schedules, and having a trainer come to them would be ideal. Implementing the trainer chat feature and calendar setup makes the whole process easier.
                <br>
                If I could recreate this app again or change anything I would add more to the dogâ€™s profile section. As the pet advances in skills perhaps offer awards or print out certificates that can be on their profile.
